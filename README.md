## Pokemon

> For this final Data Analyst project I was tasked to use a dataset and display various charts that can show visualizations to uphold any answer I may find while answering question I may have. My focus for this dataset was to find a possible connection between different Pokemon, their strength and overall power as a pokemon. I wanted to know which pokemon were more desireable and why. The main concern was is there any fighting stats you could attribute to poketype as well.


## Summary of Findings

> I ran a few codes to see if there are any correlations between stronger pokemon and the poketype they belong to. The pokemon have either a single poketype they belong to or they are a dualtype pokemon. After seperating the pokemon into datasets that hold individual types and dual Types, I was able to get a better picture of what type of pokemon had better battle stats. I pulled up the top 10 poketypes(single/dual) that held the most pokemon. I used a histplot to go over the counts of pokemon that held the highest or lowest counts in regard to battle_stats.


## Key Insights for Presentation

>The relationship between a pokemon's weight and their strength

>The correlation between The pokemon's generation and if they are a dualtype pokemon.

>The pokemon's HP and their attack points(ATK and Special_ATK).
